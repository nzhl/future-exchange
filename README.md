# 未来交易所 / Future Exchange 🌐🚀

未来交易所是一个基于 Foundry 框架编写的 Solidity 智能合约协议。它旨在帮助用户以预定的价格和时间交易未来空投的资产，如 ERC20、ERC721 或其他代币。

Future Exchange is a Solidity smart contract protocol based on the Foundry framework. It aims to facilitate the trading of future airdropped assets, such as ERC20, ERC721, or other tokens, at predetermined prices and timeframes.

## 如何工作 / How It Works 🔧🧩

1. **协议达成 / Agreement:** 买家和卖家就未来资产交换的价格和期限达成一致。双方确定押金比例并将押金转入智能合约，然后合约开始生效。Buyers and sellers agree on the price and deadline for exchanging future assets. Both parties determine the deposit ratio and transfer the deposit to the smart contract, and the contract becomes effective.
2. **Oracle 更新 / Oracle Update:** 当未来资产的具体信息被空投项目公布后，未来交易所 DAO 将信息设置到其控制的 Oracle 中。When the specific information of the future assets is announced by the airdrop project, the Future Exchange DAO sets the information in the Oracle it controls.
3. **资产交换 / Asset Exchange:** 在截止日期前，买家需要将尾款（除初始押金外的金额）存入智能合约，卖家需要将约定的空投资产数量转入合约。一旦双方完成资产交换，交易即视为完成。Before the deadline, the buyer needs to deposit the balance (the amount excluding the initial deposit) into the smart contract, and the seller needs to transfer the agreed number of airdrop assets into the contract. Once both parties complete the asset exchange, the transaction is considered complete.
4. **违约金 / Penalty:** 如果任何一方未能在期限内履行义务，他们的押金将被视为违约金，并由另一方获得。If either party fails to fulfill their obligations within the deadline, their deposit will be considered a penalty and will be acquired by the other party.
