# Future Swap 🌐🚀

Future Swap is a Solidity smart contract protocol based on the Foundry framework. It aims to facilitate the trading of future airdropped assets, such as ERC20, ERC721, or other tokens, at predetermined prices and timeframes.

## How It Works 🔧🧩

1. **Agreement:** Buyers and sellers agree on the price and deadline for exchanging future assets. Both parties determine the deposit ratio and transfer the deposit to the smart contract, and the contract becomes effective.
2. **Oracle Update:** When the specific information of the future assets is announced by the airdrop project, the Future Swap DAO sets the information in the Oracle it controls.
3. **Asset Exchange:** Before the deadline, the buyer needs to deposit the balance (the amount excluding the initial deposit) into the smart contract, and the seller needs to transfer the agreed number of airdrop assets into the contract. Once both parties complete the asset exchange, the transaction is considered complete.
4. **Penalty:** If either party fails to fulfill their obligations within the deadline, their deposit will be considered a penalty and will be acquired by the other party.
